# Resources Folder

This folder should contain:

1. **GoogleService-Info.plist** - Download from Firebase Console
   - Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/
   - Select your project
   - Go to Project Settings → Your apps → iOS app
   - Download GoogleService-Info.plist
   - Place it here: `KidsScheduler/Resources/GoogleService-Info.plist`

2. **Assets** (if needed in future)
   - App icons
   - Launch images
   - Other resources

## Important

DO NOT commit `GoogleService-Info.plist` to git!
It's already in `.gitignore` for security.
