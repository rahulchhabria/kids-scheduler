# Files to Add to Xcode Project

## Build Error
The new view files need to be added to the Xcode project target. You'll see errors like:
```
error: cannot find 'CalendarView' in scope
error: cannot find 'GroupsView' in scope
error: cannot find 'CreatePlaydateView' in scope
```

## How to Fix

1. Open **KidsScheduler.xcodeproj** in Xcode

2. **Right-click** on the project navigator and select **"Add Files to KidsScheduler..."**

3. Add these folders (they contain all the new files):
   - `KidsScheduler/Views/Calendar/`
   - `KidsScheduler/Views/Groups/`
   - `KidsScheduler/Views/Playdates/`

4. When adding, make sure to:
   - ✅ Check **"Copy items if needed"** is UNCHECKED (files are already in place)
   - ✅ Check **"Create groups"** is selected
   - ✅ Check **"KidsScheduler"** target is selected
   - ✅ Click **Add**

5. **Also add these new service and viewmodel files individually:**

   Services:
   - `KidsScheduler/Services/GroupService.swift`
   - `KidsScheduler/Services/PlaydateService.swift`

   ViewModels:
   - `KidsScheduler/ViewModels/CalendarViewModel.swift`
   - `KidsScheduler/ViewModels/GroupViewModel.swift`
   - `KidsScheduler/ViewModels/PlaydateCreationViewModel.swift`

## Alternative: Add All at Once

You can also select the entire `KidsScheduler` folder and choose "Add Files", then Xcode will automatically find all new Swift files.

## Files Created

### Views
- ✅ `KidsScheduler/Views/Calendar/CalendarView.swift` - Complete calendar UI with month view
- ✅ `KidsScheduler/Views/Groups/GroupsView.swift` - Groups list and management
- ✅ `KidsScheduler/Views/Groups/CreateGroupView.swift` - Create new group form
- ✅ `KidsScheduler/Views/Groups/JoinGroupView.swift` - Join group with invite code
- ✅ `KidsScheduler/Views/Groups/GroupDetailView.swift` - Group details and members
- ✅ `KidsScheduler/Views/Playdates/CreatePlaydateView.swift` - 4-step playdate creation flow

### ViewModels
- ✅ `KidsScheduler/ViewModels/CalendarViewModel.swift` - Calendar data management
- ✅ `KidsScheduler/ViewModels/GroupViewModel.swift` - Group operations
- ✅ `KidsScheduler/ViewModels/PlaydateCreationViewModel.swift` - Playdate creation logic

### Services
- ✅ `KidsScheduler/Services/GroupService.swift` - Firestore group operations
- ✅ `KidsScheduler/Services/PlaydateService.swift` - Firestore playdate operations

### Updated Files
- ✅ `KidsScheduler/Views/MainTabView.swift` - Integrated all three features

## After Adding Files

1. **Build the project** (⌘B) to verify all files are included
2. **Run in simulator** to test the new features
3. The app should now show:
   - Calendar view with mock playdates
   - Groups view with mock groups
   - Create playdate flow (4 steps)
   - All features working in debug mode

## What You'll See

### Calendar Tab
- Month view with navigation
- Day cells with playdate indicators
- Selected date highlighting
- List of playdates for selected day
- "Today" button to jump to current date

### Groups Tab
- List of all groups
- Create group button
- Join group button
- Group details with members
- Share invite code functionality

### Create Tab (Center +)
- Step 1: Select group
- Step 2: Basic info (title, activity type, description)
- Step 3: Time & location
- Step 4: Invite friends
- Progress indicator showing current step

All features use mock data in DEBUG_MODE and are fully functional!
